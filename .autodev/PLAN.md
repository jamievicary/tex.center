# tex.center — Plan

Cron: `N%10==0` refactor, `N%10==1` plan-review.

## 1. Current state

Live product (https://tex.center): core loop works end-to-end —
login, project list, project open, edit → save → PDF render,
refresh persistence. Per-project sidecar runs on Fly Machines in
`fra` with TCP-probe cold-start, 1024MB RAM, scale-to-zero
idle-stop. M7.0.2 shared-sidecar pool (`tex-center-sidecar` app
with `app`-tagged deployment machines) exists alongside but isn't
routed to. Iteration indicator wired through Dockerfile build-arg
into the topbar (regression-locked).

The remaining user-visible regression is **edit→preview**: live
GT-3 and GT-5 are RED by design. Iter 202 grep of post-iter-199 Fly
logs confirms **Path 2** is the live failure mode:

```
supertex: WARN no usable rollback target for .../main.tex@73
  (checkpoint=1 resumed_pid=-1)
[supertex-daemon event] round-done
```

i.e. `process_event`'s `select_for` returns `eff_n=1` but the
selected checkpoint's frozen sibling is gone (`resumed_pid=-1`),
fired in `supertex_daemon.c:1230-1238` (handshake-mode `recompile,N`
driver). The handshake path emits a bare `[round-done]` with **no
recovery**, while the *post-handshake* watch-loop path
(supertex_daemon.c:1695-1702) recovers from the same condition via
iter-711's `WATCH_LOOP_RECOMPILE_RC` → in-process recompile. The
asymmetry is the bug. Full diagnosis in `.autodev/logs/202.md`.

## 2. Milestones

### M9.editor-ux — live editor UX bugs (TDD via gold)

Done and locked: clickable logo, no-flash editor load, compile
coalescer (extracted to `apps/sidecar/src/compileCoalescer.ts`
iter 200), sustained-typing safety, toast store + component
scaffold, toast consumers for `file-op-error` and compile errors,
debug-mode toggle (URL/localStorage/Ctrl+Shift+D) with protocol
fan-out via `WsDebugEvent`. Sidecar `assembleSegment` directory-
scan fallback removed; `compile()` short-circuits to
`{ segments: [] }` on a no-op round. Gold restructure (iter 197):
`sharedLiveProject` runs a 180s warm-up to first `pdf-segment`,
per-spec polls trimmed so GT-3/GT-5 RED fast (~10s) instead of
~5min.

Toast store API (frozen iter 179):
`{ category, text, ttlMs?, persistent?, aggregateKey? }`. Same
`aggregateKey` within 500ms re-arms TTL and bumps `count`.

Remaining slices:

- **M7.4.x — upstream supertex_daemon.c recovery for handshake
  `recompile,N`.** Blocks live GT-3 and GT-5. Diagnosis closed
  in iter 202 (see `.autodev/logs/202.md`): Path 2 confirmed
  live. Fix: mirror iter-711's `WATCH_LOOP_RECOMPILE_RC` →
  in-process recompile recovery from the post-handshake watch
  loop into the handshake-mode `recompile,N` driver's
  no-usable-rollback else-branch
  (`vendor/supertex/tools/supertex_daemon.c:1230-1238`). After
  the recompile, discard old daemon-dir chunks and re-emit from
  page 1, then close the round with `[round-done]`. Sidecar
  layer needs no change — `assembleSegment` consumes the
  recompile chunks just as it consumes a normal-rollback's
  chunks. Workflow: commit in `vendor/supertex/` submodule
  (`jamievicary/supertex` upstream), push, bump submodule
  pointer in this repo. Pair with a unit test in
  `test_supertex_daemon_real` driving the `recompile,N` path
  through a forced `resumed_pid=-1`.
- **GT-E (local Playwright).** info/success/error spawn the right
  toast; repeated `file-op-error` produces a `×N` aggregated badge.
- **GT-F (local Playwright).** `?debug=1` flips localStorage; a
  single keystroke produces a green Yjs-op toast and (after
  compile) a blue pdf-segment toast; rapid typing aggregates into
  one green `×N`; without the flag, no debug toasts.
- **Save-feedback affordance.** `SyncStatus` indicator
  (idle/in-flight/error) sourced from Yjs provider sync state
  acked by a sidecar persistence signal (NOT per-keystroke). The
  success toast lives here and depends on the same ack — gated on
  a sidecar persistence-ack wire signal that doesn't exist yet.
  Local + live Playwright variants.

### M11.file-tree — tree component + CRUD UX (post-MVP UX)

Native Svelte 5 component (no React island, no third-party tree
lib). Sub-slices, each its own iteration:

- **M11.1** read-only collapsible tree (folders inferred from
  `/`-separated paths). Replaces flat picker.
- **M11.2** create/delete/rename via context menu + keyboard
  (`F2`, `Del`-with-confirm). Reuses extant sidecar verbs.
- **M11.3** create folder via virtual-folder model (no sentinel
  file; folder materialises on first child).
- **M11.4** intra-tree DnD move = rename op; one file per drag.
- **M11.5** OS-drop upload. **Blocked by FUTURE_IDEAS "binary
  asset upload"** for non-UTF-8 payloads — text-only is
  insufficient since the real motivation is image/PDF/font drops.

### M12.panels — draggable dividers (post-MVP UX)

Native `<ResizableSplit>` Svelte component, no library. Pointer
capture + CSS custom-property widths. Per-project widths persisted
to `localStorage` keyed by `projectId`. Min widths: ~200px editor,
~200px PDF; file picker collapsible to zero with a re-open chevron.
Single iteration. Local gold: drag → reload → widths persist.

### M13.open-latency — instrument-then-fix (post-MVP UX)

- **M13.1** `performance.mark` at click → route loaded → WS open
  → Yjs sync complete → first text paint → first pdf-segment.
  Surface via iter-187 `?debug=1` toast fan-out. Local gold
  asserts mark ordering + monotonic timestamps.
- **M13.2** single highest-impact fix indicated by M13.1 data.
  Likely overlaps M7.0.2 shared-sidecar pool if cold-start
  dominates; in that case M13.2 may collapse into M7.0.2
  sequencing rather than ship separately.

Default sequencing (M11–M13 all post-MVP, ordered after MVP-gap
M7.4.x and the GT-E/GT-F/save-feedback work): M13.1 → M12 →
M11.1–M11.4 → M13.2. M11.5 gated on binary-asset wire work.

### M8.pw.3.3 — real-OAuth-callback live activation

Code complete. Operator-gated: create test OAuth client in GCP
(redirect `http://localhost:4567/oauth-callback`), run
`scripts/google-refresh-token.mjs`, push `TEST_OAUTH_BYPASS_KEY`
to Fly secrets. Then `verifyLiveOauthCallback.spec.ts` un-skips.

### M7.4.2 — upstream supertex serialise/restore

PR against `github.com/jamievicary/supertex` adding state
serialisation. Gates checkpoint persistence ever being observable.
**Deferred**, post-MVP hardening. Distinct from M7.4.x above
(which is the rollback-target bug, not serialisation).

### M7.5 — daemon-adoption hardening

Rate limits, observability surface, narrower deploy tokens.
**Deferred**, post-MVP.

### Completed

M0–M7.5.5; M8.smoke.0; M8.pw.0–M8.pw.4-reused; M9.observability
(iter 163); M9.cold-start-retry (iter 164 + 168 TCP-probe);
M9.resource-hygiene (iter 175 spec teardown + count guardrail;
iter 176 idle-stop arm at startup); M9.gold-restructure (iter 197,
warm-up + fast per-spec timeouts); M10.branding (iter 194, logo
SVGs at `apps/web/src/lib/logos/{linear,stacked}.svg`, inlined via
Vite `?raw` import; brand wrapper is
`<span role="img" aria-label="tex.center">`, editor route uses
`<a class="brand">`); iter-200 coalescer extraction
(`apps/sidecar/src/compileCoalescer.ts`). See git log and
`.autodev/logs/` for detail.

## 3. Open questions / known gaps

- **Cold-start fresh-project flakiness.** Iter 182 replaced
  single-shot canvas evaluates with a bounded 30s `expect.poll`
  re-locating `.preview canvas` each tick and bumped GT-A's
  `.cm-content` timeout to 120s. If recurrence appears, next step
  is `flyctl machine logs` from a failing run under the
  leaked-subprocess hygiene rules below.
- **Per-project vs shared-sidecar routing.** Current model is
  per-project Machine. Shared-pool app-tagged machines exist but
  aren't routed to. Decision deferred to post-MVP.
- **FUTURE_IDEAS items** — see `.autodev/FUTURE_IDEAS.md`. Can be
  picked up by an iter when no critical-path work is queued.

## Leaked-subprocess hygiene (per `150_answer.md`)

Do NOT invoke `flyctl proxy`, `flyctl logs -f`, `tail -f`,
`watch`, or any daemon-style command via Bash without
`timeout --kill-after=2 Ns …` wrapping, or `run_in_background:true`
paired with an explicit kill before iteration end. Never pipe
such a command into a downstream that waits for EOF (`… | tail
-N`, `… | head`) — that pipeline shape wedged iter 148.
